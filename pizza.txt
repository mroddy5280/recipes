Take some bomb dough and kneed that bad boy out. Make sure to get it nice and
thin before you apply the sauce. Most like to use the og red sauce, I like to
mix it up with some creamy white sauce or a garlic sauce. Then slap some cheese
all over the place. You can add other toppings after this, its all up to you.
I like to add some hot peppers, olives and pineaple.
